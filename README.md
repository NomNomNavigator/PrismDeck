user likes comedies, ratings that are between 3-5 stars and a certain time that movies were released, they will get recommnedations based on that very input.

    recommendations based on that as well

- **Match & Rank**
  - The application will pick out movies based off a algorithm or rules and a trained model

## Dataset:
That the data set we will be using is from a folder of csv files gathered from Movie Lens - https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/latest/ . We will be using the csv files to help with the rules algorithm as well as using the data to help train our model
